Ranked Ballot Engine
====================

A ranked ballot voting simulator that allows people to vote for candidates in a simulated election, then illustrate how the finally 50%+1 winner is tabulated.

This is the code behind the voting simulator on vote.ottawa123.ca (and perhaps other '123' websites).
